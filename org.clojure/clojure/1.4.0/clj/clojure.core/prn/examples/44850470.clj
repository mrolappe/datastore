;; prn outputs items in a machine-readable format, such as in a source
                                        ; file. Note the double-quotes around the string "hello" and the escaped letter "c".

;; > ["hello" :a 1 (:b 2) \c {:d 4} #{5 6 7}]
;; => nil

;; println is for human-readable output, like a report. Note the lack of quotes around the string "hello", and the unescaped letter "c". 
(println items)
;; > [hello :a 1 (:b 2) c {:d 4} #{5 6 7}]
;; => nil

;; pr-str produces a string with escaped punctuation, so that println yields the same result as the original prn call.
